    Wraps a string with ANSI control codes to enable basic terminal-based
    formatting on that string. Note: Not all terminals will be compatible!
    Don't worry if you don't know what this means - this is completely
    optional to use, and not required to complete the project!

    Arguments:

    str -- String to apply ANSI control codes to
    bold -- True if you want the text to be rendered bold
    color -- Colour of the text. Currently only red/"r" and blue/"b" are
        supported, but this can easily be extended if desired...

    For help with visualisation and debugging: output a board diagram with
    any information you like (tokens, heuristic values, distances, etc.).

    Arguments:

    n -- The size of the board
    board_dict -- A dictionary with (r, q) tuples as keys (following axial
        coordinate system from specification) and printable objects (e.g.
        strings, numbers) as values.
        This function will arrange these printable values on a hex grid
        and output the result.
        Note: At most the first 5 characters will be printed from the string
        representation of each value.
    message -- A printable object (e.g. string, number) that will be placed
        above the board in the visualisation. Default is "" (no message).
    ansi -- True if you want to use ANSI control codes to enrich the output.
        Compatible with terminals supporting ANSI control codes. Default
        False.
    
    Any other keyword arguments are passed through to the print function.

    Example:

        >>> board_dict = {
        ...     (0, 4): "hello",
        ...     (1, 1): "r",
        ...     (1, 2): "b",
        ...     (3, 2): "$",
        ...     (2, 3): "***",
